                <h3>Mishneh Torah</h3>
                <p>Mishneh Torah:
                    Maimonides composed the "Mishneh Torah," a comprehensive code of Jewish law. It gathered all binding
                    laws from the Talmud and incorporated the positions of the Geonim. Despite initial opposition, it
                    became a monumental contribution to the systemized writing of halakha (Jewish law).</p>
