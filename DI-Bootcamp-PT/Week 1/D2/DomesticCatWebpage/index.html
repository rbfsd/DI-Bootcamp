                <h3>About domestic cats</h3>

                    distinguish them from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for companionship.
                </p>
                <p>There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.</p>

                <h2>The Lions</h2>
                <p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in
                    dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being
                    active at night and at twilight.</p>
                <p>A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and
                    composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females
                    cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra
                    and even giraffe.</p>
